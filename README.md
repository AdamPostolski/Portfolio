### Rules:
The game consists in guessing the randomly selected word using the 5-letter word entered by the player.

The word entered by the player must contain 5 letters (no less, no more) and must be in the dictionary of the Polish language.

The selected entries must be in the Polish dictionary and must be a noun in the nominative singular, a masculine adjective in the singular or a verb in the infinitive.

After entering the words, the letters will be marked in color:
- green - if the given letter appears in the same place in the guessing word
- orange - if the given letter appears in the guessing word but in other place
- grey - if the given letter does not appear in the guessing word

The player has 6 attempts to guess the word, if during these attempts he manages to guess the word - he wins.

When guessed (or not) a window pops up with the result. It allows you to draw another word.
